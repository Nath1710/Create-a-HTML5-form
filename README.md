This repository contains the "Create an HTML5 Form" project from the HTML FORMS module. In this project, I focused on making my code responsive and used JavaScript functions for learning purposes.

To test one of the implemented functions, the following card numbers are available for the Card# field:

1017 2208 2604 2504
1105 2611 1010 1709
You can use these provided credit card numbers and observe the results when you click the Submit button. Each number triggers a different outcome. If you use the Cancel button, a message will be displayed.

For a full experience, you can fill out all the fields. Try entering alphabetic characters in the Card#, CVC#, and Amount fields, and explore the State options.
